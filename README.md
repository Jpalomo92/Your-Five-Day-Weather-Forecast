# Your-Five-Day-Weather-Forecast

## Description

In this project, I created a weather app that will give show the weather over the next five days for the city that the user searches. 

This application allows the user to search up any name of a city and the application is to then retrieve the data from the Openweathermap API. Once the data is pulled, its displayed in the dom and saved to the local storage. 

I attempted to create a variable that would retrieve the city name entered into the search bar and list it into the URL. From here it would then fetch the data called. 

You will see in the javascript that there is a lot of code scrapped out. I decided to keep on here to show that I have tried, however, there are points where I think I'm going down the incorrect path and decide to restart.

This homework has by far been my biggest challenge.
